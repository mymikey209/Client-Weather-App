weather app sprint 5
during this assinment i was assingened a clienst weather app and i had to do my best to recreate the prototype


Peer Review: Max Mendoza: Michaels app isnt finished but it does look like it is close. The design and nice and the code looks right just needs a bit more work on it. Overall it does look like its on track to being complete
